## Motivation

The motivation behind the Shebeen Health Clinic project is to provide a seamless and efficient way for patients to book and attend medical appointments remotely. In the era of digital transformation, healthcare should not be left behind. This project aims to bring convenience to patients, allowing them to consult with healthcare professionals without the need to travel. This would be especially beneficial in case the global situation requires social distancing once again. Furthermore, it provides a streamlined platform for healthcare providers to manage appointments and consult with patients, making healthcare more accessible and efficient.

## Code Style

This project adheres to certain coding conventions for consistency and readability. Here are some of the key points:

- **Indentation:** We use 2 spaces for indentation. No tabs are allowed.
- **Semicolons:** Every statement should be ended with a semicolon.
- **Quotes:** Use single quotes for strings except to avoid escaping.
- **Naming Convention:** We use camelCase for variable and function names, and PascalCase for component/class names.
- **Braces:** Opening braces go on the same line as the statement.
- **Variable Declaration:** Always use `let` or `const` to declare variables. Don't use `var`.

We use [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) to make sure formatting is proper and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) to enforce these conventions. Before committing any code, make sure to run ESLint to check for and fix any style issues.

To run ESLint, use the following command:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Code Examples

1. **Starting the server (backend/src/server.js):**

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 5000;

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

2. **API Paths (frontend/src/API/api_paths.js):**

```javascript
const API_BASE = "http://localhost:8000/";
const PACKAGE_BASE = "http://localhost:8000/package/";
const DOCTOR_BASE = "http://localhost:8000/doctor/";
// ... more paths ...

export const API_PATHS = {
  // Guest
  docSignUp: `${GUEST_BASE}addRequest/`,
  updateEmail: `${GUEST_BASE}updateEmail/`,
  // ... more paths ...
};
```

3. **Custom Login Hook:**

```javascript
import axios from "axios";
import { API_PATHS } from "API/api_paths";
import { useState } from "react";
import { useAuthContext } from "./useAuthContext";

export const useLogin = () => {
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const { dispatch } = useAuthContext();

  const login = async (username, password) => {
    setLoading(true);
    setError(null);
    try {
      const res = await axios.post(API_PATHS.login, {
        Username: username,
        Password: password,
      });
      const json = JSON.stringify(res.data);
      localStorage.setItem("LocalStorageItemNameHere", json);
      dispatch({ type: "LOGIN", payload: res.data });
      setLoading(false);
      return res;
    } catch (err) {
      setLoading(false);
      setError(err.response.data.message);
      return err.response;
    }
  };

  return { login, error, loading };
};
```

4. **Rescheduling a doctor's appointment**

```javascript
const reschedulePatient = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const docUsername = req.user.Username;
    const { patientUsername, date } = req.body;
    const prevApp = await appointmentModel.findOne({
      DoctorUsername: docUsername,
      PatientUsername: patientUsername,
      Status: "Upcoming",
    });
    const reqDate = new Date(date);
    if (!prevApp) {
      res
        .status(404)
        .json({ err: "Patient wasn't scheduled for an upcoming appointment!" });
      return;
    } else if (
      prevApp.Date.getFullYear() == reqDate.getFullYear() &&
      prevApp.Date.getMonth() + 1 == reqDate.getMonth() + 1 &&
      prevApp.Date.getDate() + 1 == reqDate.getDate() + 1 &&
      prevApp.Date.getUTCHours() == reqDate.getUTCHours()
    ) {
      res.status(404).json({
        err: "You're rescheduling appointment on the same date it's scheduled on!",
      });
    } else {
      const patientApp = await appointmentModel.find({
        $or: [
          { PatientUsername: patientUsername, Status: "Upcoming" },
          { DoctorUsername: docUsername, Status: "Upcoming" },
        ],
      });
      const reqDate = new Date(date);
      let isBooked = false;
      for (const appReserved of patientApp) {
        if (
          reqDate.getFullYear() == appReserved.Date.getFullYear() &&
          reqDate.getMonth() + 1 == appReserved.Date.getMonth() + 1 &&
          reqDate.getDate() == appReserved.Date.getDate() &&
          reqDate.getUTCHours() == appReserved.Date.getUTCHours()
        ) {
          isBooked = true;
          break;
        }

        if (isBooked) {
          res
            .status(400)
            .json({ err: "There is another appointment booked on same date!" });
          return;
        } else {
          const updateAppOld = await appointmentModel.findOneAndUpdate(
            {
              PatientUsername: patientUsername,
              DoctorUsername: docUsername,
              Status: "Upcoming",
            },
            { Date: date, Status: "Rescheduled" }
          );
          const newApp = await appointmentModel.create({
            PatientUsername: patientUsername,
            PatientName: updateAppOld.PatientName,
            DoctorName: updateAppOld.DoctorName,
            DoctorUsername: docUsername,
            Status: "Upcoming",
            Date: date,
          });
          res
            .status(200)
            .json("You have rescheduled appointment successfully!");
          return;
        }
      }
    }
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(404).json(error);
  }
};
```
