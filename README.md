## Tests

To run jest tests, run the following command

The api routes were tested using postman , Postman is an application used for API testing. It is an HTTP client that tests HTTP requests, utilizing a graphical user interface, through which we obtain different types of responses that need to be subsequently validated. Postman offers many endpoint interaction methods. The following are some of the most used, including their functions:

    GET: Obtain information
    POST: Add information
    PUT: Replace information
    PATCH: Update certain information
    DELETE: Delete information

And we tested the behaviour of our routes and if they produce the correct status code and response according to our project flow .

Many testing routes were created to test the various API endpoints through postman. You can find these in [API_REFERENCE.md](API_REFERENCE.md)
