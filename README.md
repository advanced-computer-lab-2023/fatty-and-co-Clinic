## Motivation
## Build Status

- Project is in development stage
- unit tests are needed
- UI and UX need to be improved in several areas such as booking an appointment and viewing doctor requests
- [include all missing or broken requirements here]

## Code Style

This project adheres to certain coding conventions for consistency and readability. Here are some of the key points:

- **Indentation:** We use 2 spaces for indentation. No tabs are allowed.
- **Semicolons:** Every statement should be ended with a semicolon.
- **Quotes:** Use single quotes for strings except to avoid escaping.
- **Naming Convention:** We use camelCase for variable and function names, and PascalCase for component/class names.
- **Braces:** Opening braces go on the same line as the statement.
- **Variable Declaration:** Always use `let` or `const` to declare variables. Don't use `var`.

We use [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) to make sure formatting is proper so make sure to use it when writing code.

### Design Pattern

The project follows the MVC design pattern ,MVC is a software architectural pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divide the related program logic into three interconnected elements. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user , So the Files in the backend was divided into the M (models) where the schema of the models exist which represent the core of the database , the C (controller) where the functions needed for the routes exists and the V (views) the view in MERN stack is represented by the react frontend server.

`API_KEY`

`ANOTHER_API_KEY`


## API Reference

#### Get all items

```http
  GET /api/items
```

| Parameter | Type     | Description                |

#### add(num1, num2)

Takes two numbers and returns the sum.


## Tests

To run jest tests, run the following command

```bash
  npm run test
```

The api routes were tested using postman , Postman is an application used for API testing. It is an HTTP client that tests HTTP requests, utilizing a graphical user interface, through which we obtain different types of responses that need to be subsequently validated. Postman offers many endpoint interaction methods. The following are some of the most used, including their functions:

    GET: Obtain information
    POST: Add information
    PUT: Replace information
    PATCH: Update certain information
    DELETE: Delete information

And we tested the behaviour of our routes and if they produce the correct status code and response according to our project flow .

Many testing routes were created to test the various API endpoints through postman. You can find these in [API_REFERENCE.md](API_REFERENCE.md)
